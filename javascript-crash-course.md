- [__7 Days of JavaScript:__](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/7days-javascript/) This is a hackerrank contest from last year. The challenges say they are locked, but that just means the leaderboard is locked. I would like you to try all the problems up to and including [__Day 4: Data Types__](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/7days-javascript/challenges/basic-data-type).

- [__Hackerrank Algorithms__](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/warmup): For those looking for a real challenge try going back to the problems in the algorithm section on hackerrank and solve some of those in JavaScript.
